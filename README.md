# FlightFinder

One of the things I enjoy doing the most is traveling. But, as a university student, I need to travel on a budget. That is why I love tools like SkyScanner, which can show me the cheapest destinations for a given port of depature. My goals with this tool are to relearn Python, learn how to connect desktop applications to different public APIs for increased functionality, and to ultimately make a tool that will give me a list of the cheapest destinations 1 week into the future at any given day. This will be a novelty app and little more, though perhaps it will actually be useful one day.
